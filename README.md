Generate a password from your choice of characters

Clicking the button initiates the code.  The user is asked how many characters they would like their password to contain and vaidation ensures that the number that they select is greater than 8 and less than 128.

The user is asked whether they would like to include several arrays (special characters, numbers and upper and lower case letters).  Validation ensures the user selects at least one array.

The random password generated then prints to the webpage.
